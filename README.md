## Cave Explorer
- You play as a miner who is seeking to become rich so he explores caves looking to mine expensive minerals to sell. Getting these minerals is no easy task though, since these caves are infested with monsters who are eager to dine on our curious explorers. Fortunately, our miner has an ace up his sleeve, he has inherited maps which can guide him through the caves safely past the monsters and to the rarest of minerals. The miner must do this quickly or risk having his scent picked up by the monsters, ending up on the menu for them.
